        <h2>Welcome to Chef's Corner!</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Kanchan Pitlawar, a seasoned software engineer with four years of experience in the tech world. Beyond the lines of code and the fast-paced tech landscape, I discovered an unexpected passion for the culinary arts. In 2021, I decided to blend my love for coding with my newfound enthusiasm for cooking, giving birth to my Instagram page â€“ a virtual kitchen where I share not just recipes, but the stories behind each dish.

          My culinary journey is a fusion of flavors, techniques, and a continuous quest for innovation. From crafting pixel-perfect code to perfecting the art of plating, I've found that the attention to detail in software engineering seamlessly translates to the precision required in the kitchen. Each dish is a unique experiment, a blend of creativity and methodical execution.

Moreover, for those interested in the professional side of my journey, my LinkedIn page is a hub for discussions on the intersection of technology and culinary arts.
